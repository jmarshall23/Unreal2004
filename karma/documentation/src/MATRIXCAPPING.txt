Matrix Capping
==============

"Matrix capping" is a trick used by Mdt to heuristically reduce the size
of the mathematical problem solved by the Kea solver.

Since PlayStation 2 has a limited VU0 data memory (of 4K), limiting this
size to 36 has considerable performance advantages. Kea can cope with
larger matrix sizes, but needs to use a "matrix blocking" strategy to
buffer data in and out of the VU0 memory; when the size is less than 36,
the whole problem fits in the memory at once, and so it is possible to
compute the solution very rapidly.

Note, however, that there is a tradeoff. Matrix capping works by
eliminating constraint rows according to heuristics. This means that in
some cases, noticeably "incorrect" behaviour can result.

This can sometimes give the impression of unstable behaviour in extreme
cases, but the behaviour is not due to mathematical instability; if you
experience difficulties, try disabling Matrix capping.

This is simply achieved by removing the line that starts
"MdtWorldSetMaxMatrixSize"

Many of these Mdt samples have Matrix capping enabled.
