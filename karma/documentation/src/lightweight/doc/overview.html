	<p><h2><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A new approach to game dynamics</font></h2></p>
    </center>
 
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><p>Karma is a new way to add physics to your game. Based on our experience in engineering but 100% rewritten for games and 100% optimized for
every target platform.</p>
 
<p>Karma gets the physics into the game fast letting your gameplay take shape from early on and helping you hit milestones early.</p>
 
<p>Karma cuts the pain and risk of optimization by letting you use full-speed physics at the start of your project even on the most complex
consoles.</p>
 
<p>Karma lets you prototype quickly so you can find out what can and can't be done in a frame. We can even do the prototyping for you
reducing your risk further.</p>
<p>We've learnt a lot about physics for games the hard way and we've put everything we've learnt into Karma. That's helped Karma
already win some of the most respected game developers in the world as customers.</p>
<p>They've found that:
<ul> 
<li>Karma is faster by an order of magnitude with no visible loss of realism.</li>
 
<li>Karma is stable without tweaking and tuning thanks to our novel approach.</li>
 
<li>Karma doesn't compromise. It comes with source code to let you customize it and make it optimal for your game.</li>
</ul> 
</p> 
<p>Karma is a complete package. Collision and rigid body dynamics modules are provided with a simulation toolkit that manages the scene.</p>

<center><p><b>Rigid Body Dynamics</b></p></center>
 
<p>Karma can be used to build realistic articulated rigid-body simulations, including the use of multiple joint types, soft
and hard joint limits and spring-like recreation with multiple nodes as needed.</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Numerically stable methods</li>
 
<li>Manages several joint types and several actuation models.</li>
 
<li>Simulates hard and soft contact constraints.</li>                                                                            
<li>Provides a fast and stable friction model.</li>
 </ul>
 
 
<center><p><b>Collision Detection</b></p></center>
 
<p>Karma provides advanced algorithms that are optimized to calculate the collisions between a variety of objects such as
geometrical primitives (spheres, boxes and cylinders) for as well as more advanced types such as convex, terrains and even arbitrary polygon
meshes.</p>
 
<ul>

<li>Selectable geometry types with fast, tunable, collision detection and contact generation for stable collision response.</li>
 
<li>Efficient handling of a large number of objects.</li>
 
<li>Velocity consideration of small high speed objects</li>
 
<li>Flexible plugin architecture allowing selective type linking and user geometry types.</li>
 </ul>
 
Additional features:
 
<ul>
<li>Detailed and comprehensive manuals</li>
 
<li>Relevant code examples for all main features and uses</li>
 
<li>Extensions to provide rapid vehicle and human animation development</li>
 
<li>Evaluation tutorials to help rapid assessment.</li>
 
<li>White papers detailing our approach to each platform including processor and memory usage details</li>
 
<li>Any level of support required from email only, to on-site and consultancy</li>
 
<li>Pricing of $50,000 per title, per platform</li>
</ul> 


<center><p><b>Releases available</b></p></center>

<p>Karma is available as a single precision build for the following platforms:</p>

<ul> 
<li>Windows</li>
