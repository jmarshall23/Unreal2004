<h1>Windows NT/2000 Build Environment for CVS Repository 'projects'</h1>

<ul>

<li>Microsoft's Visual C++ Developement environment should be installed.
<li>Cygwin Version 1.0 (or higher) should be installed. These tools can be retrieved from mathengine's internal <a href="ftp://ftp.ox.mathengine.com/pub/freew/cygwin">ftp</a> site.
<li>You should customise the Cygwin tools by creating a batch file and adding the following lines:

<pre>
set MAKE_MODE=UNIX
set HOME=&lt;PATH TO A FILE CALLED '.bashrc'>
set PATH=&lt;PATH_TO_CYGWIN_BIN_DIR>;%PATH%
call &lt;MICROSOFT_VISUAL_C++_DIR>\vc98\bin\vcvars32.bat
bash
</pre>

<li>The above 'PATH' statement is not strictly necessary but does resolves issues where Microsoft and UNIX commands (ex. 'find') have the same name.
<li>The text file '.bashrc' must contain the following text at least:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

# build environment variables needed (sometimes)
export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.mtl.mathengine.com:/proj/projects
</pre>

<li>Start Cygwin using the batch file you just created

</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li>When refering to a 'PATH' in your batch file ensure you use the '8.3' equilvalent i.e.

<ul>
<li>'...\Program Files\MyApplication\bin' <b>becomes</b> '...\Progra~1\MyAppl~1\bin' <b>or possibly</b> '...\Progra~1\MyAppl~2\bin', check using the native command shell.
</ul>

<li>The space and the '\' characters have special meaning in Cygwin. This means that when specifying a PATH in your '.bashrc' file:

<ul>
<li>'...\Program Files\MyApplication\bin' <b>becomes</b> '...\\Program\ Files\\MyApplication\\bin'
</ul>

<li>Basically the '\' character 'escapes' any special characters.
</ul>

<h3>Notes on using Windows 9x</h3>

<p>The Makefile's probably won't work due to the generally dumbness of this OS but here are some pointers anyway:

<ul>

<li>GNU Cygwin <strong>Beta</strong> tools should be installed. These tools can be retrieved from mathengine's internal <a href="ftp://ftp.ox.mathengine.com/pub/freew/CygWin-B20">ftp</a> site.
<li>Microsoft's Visual C++ Developement environment should be installed.
<li>Perl should be installed. Perl can be retrieved from <a href="http://www.perl.com">here</a>.
<li>You should customise the GNU Cygwin tools by adding the following lines to '&lt;CYGWIN_DIR>/cygwin-&lt;VERSION>/cygnus.bat':

<pre>
set MAKE_MODE=UNIX
set HOME=&lt;PATH TO A FILE CALLED '.bashrc'>
set PATH=&lt;PATH_TO_CYGWIN_BIN_DIR>;%PATH%
call &lt;MICROSOFT_VISUAL_C++_DIR>\vc98\bin\vcvars32.bat
bash
</pre>

<li>The text file '.bashrc' must contain the following text at least:

<pre>
# build environment variables needed (sometimes)
PERL=&lt;PERL_DIR>
CVS=&lt;CVS_DIR>
CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@mtlcvs.mtl.mathengine.com:/proj/projects

export CVSROOT
export PATH=${PATH}:${CVS}:${PERL}
</pre>

<li>Start the Cygwin tools and type:

<pre>
cd /
mkdir tmp
mkdir bin
cp `find -name sh.exe` /bin
</pre>

<ul>
<li>If the previous command fails to copy 'sh.exe' to /bin try executing it again in '//c', '//d', '//e' etc.
<li>Notice the use of 'back quotes' in this command.
</ul>


<li>If you get a message like 'out of environment space' add the following line to your '<strong>config.sys</strong>':

<pre>
shell=&lt;SYSTEM_ROOT>command.com /e:2048 /p
</pre>

<li>When refering to a 'PATH' in a batch file (ex. cygnus.bat) ensure you use the '8.3' equilvalent i.e.

<ul>
<li>'...\Program Files\MyApplication\bin' <b>becomes</b> '...\Progra~1\MyAppl~1\bin' <b>or possibly</b> '...\Progra~1\MyAppl~2\bin', check using the native command shell.
</ul>

<li>The space and the '\' characters have special meaning in Cygwin. This means that when specifying a PATH in your '.bashrc' file:

<ul>
<li>'...\Program Files\MyApplication\bin' <b>becomes</b> '...\\Program\ Files\\MyApplication\\bin'
</ul>

<li>Basically the '\' character 'escapes' any special characters.

</ul>
