This subdirectory contains a few files as follows.

This file is a modified version of the CodeWarrior default linker
configuration file, and technically we don't have permission to
redistribute it. In any case this is a patch:

  include/MeCWPS2.lcf

This directory contains a simple template project, and can be copied
with a name like "MathEngine PS2" to the 'Stationery' directory
of the CodeWarrior install:

  src/cwstationery
  src/cwstationery/Program.c
  src/cwstationery/Program.mcp

The stationery is only for C, but should also supports C++.

These are the project file for the 'examples' and 'tutorials':

  src/examples/examples.mcp
  src/tutorials/tutorials.mcp
