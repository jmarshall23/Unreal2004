RenderWare3 Acknowledgement
---------------------------

RenderWare3 from Criterion Software is a cross-platform game development 
toolkit including 3D rendering capabilities.

MathEngine Karma provides a geometry type representing a 
Renderware BSP Tree, namely the McdRwBSP geometry primitive.
This primitive facilitates the integration of RenderWare BSP trees with
Karma Collision.

In addition, Renderware3 is used to render the MathEngine GreaseMonkey demo.
GreaseMonkey is another example usage of McdRwBsp, although source code is 
not provided.
