(Weeks) (Who)   (What)

Changes:
P1:
0		remove references to new in particles and convex!
1	?	MeReal <- lsReal
		Do we need EEMath.inl ?

1 	?	Better error handling
			TempAssert
			Better error checking

2		Convex contact generation fix
1		terrain contact generation fix
0.5		Box-Box vertex-vertex, edge-edge contact fix

5	C	Framework cleanup
			- C model, geometries, pairs, ...
			- Dispatcher/Request broker
			- TOD dispatcher/meta dispatcher issues
			- PairData issues
			- User writable primitives and intersection functions

	C	- memory leak in pairwise registered interactions (convex)
		- next, prev model : ability to loop over all models.
	S	- check for orthonormality of rotations
		remove curvature from contacts
		turn pool/array/hashtable macros into templates

		Restructuring according to new plan:
		- pair pointer in results
		- ...


P2:
6		Convex cleanup
2		convex uses mesh data structure

P3:
1	?	Clean up use of core files 
0	B	Inconsistent use of GetSize() in Array and PtrArray.


Farfield:
P1:
		Allow auto resizing
		check pairs can be swapped
		support for keeping track of pairs per component(?)



Features:
P1:
9	ZM 	Mesh 
1	C	Composite design
1	S	Composite implementation
1	?	cone interactions
8	ZSM	TOD
4		Streaming of objects for load/save support

		Particles:
2	S	- changes to allow for linesegments
3  	S	- finish interactions with basic types

P2:
  		interactions with mesh types                  3?      S

P3:
1	?	Add Sphyll-Sphyll, ...
?	SJM	Particle and aerodynamics collision
3	*	Simple Grid-Based Farfield


Optimization
P1:
?	DW	PS2 Optmisation
