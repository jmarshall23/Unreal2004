This is MathEngine's Karma source code, version 1.2.1e. It has been hacked up
 to make it portable to 64-bit systems, optimizations have been added for
 MacOS X, and several bugfixes have been applied...at least, hopefully that
 will all be true by the time you read this.  :)

Do not distribute this directory to licensees without checking with Jay Wilbur
 first to make sure the legal paperwork is in place.

My work on this was done out of necessity, and I don't claim to have a deep
 understanding of any of the code in here, including the parts I had to touch.
 Please don't ask me questions about it; I just don't know.
