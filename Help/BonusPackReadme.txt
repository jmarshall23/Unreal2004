Unreal Tournament 2003 BONUS PACK ONE

(C) 2003 Epic Games
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for downloading the Bonus Pack!

This pack is our way of saying "Thanks" for purchasing UT2003. We hope you enjoy it!

You must be patched to at least version 2186 to use the bonus pack.

Be sure to check out UNREAL 2: THE AWAKENING - in stores now!

In addition to 10 new maps with new textures and static meshes, we've also included
three new game types and two new adrenaline combos.  There are also several new
announcer voice options, which can be configured in the settings|audio menu.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The two new adrenaline combos can be added using mutators.  

Pint-Sized: makes you pint sized - you become half normal height (but you can no longer 
crouch).  

Camouflage: puts a holographic projection of a static decoration over you as a 
disguise. The projection doesn't quite extend to your feet, so you have to crouch to 
be really hidden.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The three new game types are:

MUTANT:  Initially, its a free for all deathmatch.  However, as soon as one guy 
makes a kill, he becomes the Mutant. Everyone else stops fighting (you 
can't hurt each other anymore), and guns for the Mutant instead.  You 
score points by racking up kills while you're the Mutant:

Normal Kill: 2 Points
Double Kill: 3 Points
Multi Kill (and above): 4 Points

Mutants get all (non-super) weapons and lots of ammo, and have 
invisibility, agility and berserk.  However, their health slowly runs 
down and can only be replenished by killing other players. Also, 
everyone else has a radar showing where the mutant is.

As an optional twist, the player with the lowest score is the 
BottomFeeder - he can also go around killing other players
(with scores as a result).  As soon as his score isn't the lowest, a new 
player becomes the BottomFeeder. This makes the game more interesting 
when you have a wide variety of skills playing. The Mutant gets 5 points 
for killing the BottomFeeder.


LAST MAN STANDING:  This is much like the Last Man Standing game from UT.  There's an 
option to get health back when you kill someone.  Also, if you stand in one place for 
too long, you get called out for camping (and your location shows up on everyone else's 
HUD).

INVASION:  In this game type, players band together to defend against waves of incoming 
monsters.  Each wave lastes between 90 seconds and 4 minutes.  Players cannot respawn if 
they die during a wave, but as long as one player makes it to the end of the wave alive, 
everyone respawns for the next wave.  Each wave contains a different combination of 12 
different types of monsters.  Note that the monster difficulty is controlled by the bot
difficulty settings in the menus.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Invasion game type uses many of the original monsters from Unreal I.  We'd like to 
credit Dave Carter, who was responsible for modeling most and animating all of these 
creatures.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This bonus pack also includes a new OGGPlayer that gives you direct control over what
music is played while you play.  By default, the OGG Player comes pre-configured to F11
and is configurable from the normal key configuration menu.

For security purposes, we have limited the OGG player to files inside your \Music
directory only.  Once activated, any .ogg file placed there will be accessible to your
play list.
