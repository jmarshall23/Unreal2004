This is the UT2003 Demo-version Readme.txt
------------------------------------------

What I want in there:

- warning that "5.1"/ "5.1 + EAX" sound can _severly_ impact 
  performance on some cards and that the first thing someone
  should do is setting sound back to "normal" after experiencing
  bad performance.

- warning that customers should not upgrade to the 40.41 NVIDIA
  drivers and if they already did they should revert to 30.82

- general note that customers should upgrade their drivers

- mention that demo content is stripped down/ lowered texture
  detail in order to maintain a manageable download size

- mention that OpenGL renderer is not supported on Windows

- mentioning some benchmarking stuff


What we need:
